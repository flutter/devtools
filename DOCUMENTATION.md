## DevTools Documentation - How To Guide
The documentation for Dart & Flutter DevTools lives on [flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/devtools/overview).

Our docs are written and pushed up the the [flutter/website](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/devtools/overview)
repo by the Flutter DevRel team. Developers working on DevTools should collaborate with Flutter tech writers by following
the below workflow.

## How to request documentation updates

1. Create a [Screencast](chrome://extensions/?id=ccbdlfckiiklnpopmgihhnegpbcgceja) (preferred) or a Google Drive video
explaining the new feature or functionality changes that require docs updates. If the feature is quick to document, you
can include a rough draft of the documentation you think should be written, but where possible, we should leave the
writing to our talented tech writers.
2. Create a Go Link pointed at your demo video.
3. Create an [new issue](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new) on the flutter/website repository.
    - Add a descriptive title for your request.
    - Add the `devtools-request` label.
    - Paste your Go Link in the issue description along with any other relvant context.

# Note: this version should only be updated by running tools/update_version.dart
# that updates all versions of packages from packages/devtools.

# of package:devtools as well. package:devtools contains a compiled snapshot of
# this package.
version: 2.11.0

environment:
  sdk: '>=2.10.0 <3.0.0'
  # The flutter desktop support interacts with build scripts on the Flutter
  # side that are not yet stable, so it requires a very recent version of
  # Flutter. This version will increase regularly as the build scripts change.

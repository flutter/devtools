# foo_devtools_extension

An example DevTools extension for `package:foo`. This flutter_web app `foo_devtools_extension`
would be embedded inside DevTools when debugging an app that imports `package:foo`. The extension
needs to be provided by `package:foo` as set forth by the requirements documented at
DevTools Extensions (TODO(kenz) - write these and add a link).

This folder contains code shared between screens.

This folder contains higher level libraries, i.e. ones, that depend on other libraries in this package.
Lower level code, i.e. code that does not depend on other code in this package, should go to the folder 'primitives'.

Code, that is not used by any screen, should go to the folder `framework`.

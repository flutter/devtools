## Writing DevTools release notes
Release notes for DevTools are hosted on the flutter website (see [archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/devtools/release-notes)).
To add release notes for the latest release, create a PR with the appropriate changes for your release (see example
[PR](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/6791)).

Test these changes locally before creating the PR. See [README.md](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/README.md)
for getting setup to run the Flutter website locally.

One you are satisfied with the release notes, stage the Flutter website on Firebase and point the DevTools release notes
logic to this staged url.

### Staging your changes on Firebase
In the flutter/website directory, open [_config.yml](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/_config.yml#L2)
and replace `https://docs.flutter.dev` with `https://flutter-website-dt-staging.web.app` (line 2).

Then run the following rom the `website/` directory:
```shell
make setup
```
```shell
DISABLE_TESTS=1 make build
```
```shell
firebase deploy --project devtools-staging --only hosting
```

If the firebase command gives an authentication error or just says it cannot access a URL, try running
`firebase logout` and `firebase login`, and then retry the `firebase deploy` command.

Once you see this message, the deployment was successful and now you can move on to the next step.
```shell
...

âœ”  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/flutter-website-dt-staging/overview
Hosting URL: https://flutter-website-dt-staging.web.app
```

### Testing the release notes in DevTools
In `release_notes.dart` flip the `debugTestReleaseNotes` flag to true. 

Then, from the main `devtools/` directory, run the following:
```dart
dart ./tool/build_e2e.dart
```

Once DevTools has been successfully built and served, you should see the following the CLI output:
```shell
...

Serving DevTools with a local devtools server...
Serving DevTools at http://127.0.0.1:57336.
```
Visit the DevTools link, and verify that the release notes viewer displays the new release notes as expected.

# Dart DevTools Allocation Tracing 

Note: This page is currently under construction.

## Description

The allocation tracing tab allows for toggling allocation
tracing for specific types, which records the locations of
allocations of instances of traced types within the
currently selected isolate.
            
Allocation sites of traced types can be viewed by refreshing
the tracing profile before selecting the traced type from the
list, displaying a condensed view of locations where objects
were allocated.

// TODO(bkonyi): add more detailed instructions with screenshots.

# Instructions for running a DevTools integration test

## Set up ChromeDriver (one time only)

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/to/integration-test-on-web) to download ChromeDriver.

2. Add `chromedriver` to your PATH by modifying your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:

```
export PATH=${PATH}:/Users/me/folder_containing_chromedriver/
```

3. Verify you can start `chromedriver`:

```
chromedriver --port=4444
```

If you get the error "'chromedriver' cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.", run the following command with your path to the `chromedriver` executable:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/path/to/chromedriver
```

### Updating ChromeDriver

If you update your Chrome version (or it updates automatically), you may need to update your `chromedriver`
executable as well. To do this, delete your existing `chromedriver` executable (you can find this by
running `which chromedriver`). Then, download the proper `chromedriver` zip file from
[here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) based on your platform. Copy the
link for your platform, open in a new tab, and then the zip file will be downloaded. Unzip the
folder, and move the executable to the same location that you just deleted the previous executable from.

If you are on Mac, you will likely need to run this command again on the new executable:
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/path/to/chromedriver
```

## Running a test

* To run all integration tets: `dart run integration_test/run_tests.dart`
* To run a single integration test: `dart run integration_test/run_tests.dart --target=integration_test/test/my_test.dart`

### Special flags:

* `--test-app-uri`: to speed up local development, you can pass in a vm service uri from a Dart or Flutter
app running on your local machine. This saves the cost of spinning up a new test app for each test run. To
do this, pass the vm service uri using the `--test-app-uri=some-uri` run flag.
* `--headless`: this will run the integration test on the 'web-server' device instead of the 'chrome' device, meaning you will not be able to see the integration test run in Chrome when running locally.
* `--update-goldens`: behaves like the `--update-goldens` flag for Flutter unit tests,
updating the golden images to the results produced by the test run.

The following flags are available, but should not be used manually. To run a test with offline data
or with experiments enabled, place the test in the proper directory, and the `run_tests.dart` script
will propagate the proper flag values automatically (see [instructions below](#where-to-add-an-integration-test))

# Where to add an integration test

Where you should place your integration test will depend on the answers to the following questions:
1. Does your test require DevTools to be connected to a live test application? This is a
["live connection"](#live-connection-integration-tests) integration test.
2. Does your test need to use offline (and stable) test data? This is an
["offline"](#offline-integration-tests) integration test.

## "live connection" integration tests

Tests under `integration_test/test/live_connection` will run DevTools and connect it to a live Dart or Flutter
application.

## "offline" integration tests

Tests under `integration_test/test/offline` will run DevTools without connecting it to a live application.
Integration tests in this directory will load offline data for testing. This is useful
for testing features that will not have stable data from a live application. For example,
the Performance screen timeline data will never be stable with a live applicaiton, so
loading offline data allows for screenshot testing without flakiness.

# In-file test arguments

Some test arguments are set in the test file directly as specifically formatted comments.

For example:
```dart
// Do not delete these arguments. They are parsed by test runner.
// test-argument:appPath="test/test_infra/fixtures/memory_app"
// test-argument:experimentsOn=true
```

For a list of such arguments, see [_in_file_args.dart](test_infra/run/_in_file_args.dart). For an example of
usage, see [eval_and_browse_test.dart](test/live_connection/eval_and_browse_test.dart).

name: devtools
description: A suite of web-based performance tooling for Dart and Flutter.

# Note: this version should only be updated by running tools/update_version.sh
# that updates all versions of packages from packages/devtools.
#
# All the real functionality has moved to the devtools_app package with this
# package remaining purely as a container for the compiled copy of the devtools
# app. That ensures that version constraints for the devtools_app do not impact
# this package.

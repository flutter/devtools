## What is it?

Dart DevTools is a suite of performance tools for Dart and Flutter. It's currently in
preview release, but we're actively working on improvements and on shipping new versions.

## What can I do with it?

DevTools supports inspecting the UI layout and state of a Flutter app, diagnosing UI
jank performance issues in a Flutter app, source-level debugging of a Flutter or Dart
command-line app, and viewing general log and diagnostics information about a running
app.

We expect developers to use DevTools in conjunction with their existing IDE or
command-line based development workflow.

## How do I install it?

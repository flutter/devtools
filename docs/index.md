## What is it?

Dart DevTools is a suite of performance tools for Dart and Flutter. It's currently in
preview release, but we're actively working on improvements and on shipping new versions.

Please note that we primarily test with Chrome and using Brave requires turning off the shield.

## What can I do with it?

DevTools supports inspecting the UI layout and state of a Flutter app, diagnosing UI
jank performance issues in a Flutter app, source-level debugging of a Flutter or Dart
command-line app, and viewing general log and diagnostics information about a running
app.

We expect developers to use DevTools in conjunction with their existing IDE or
command-line based development workflow.

## How do I install it?

See the

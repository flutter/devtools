# A CI workflow to run the Dart Code Metrics analyzer (https://dcm.dev).

# NOTE: DCM usage in DevTools is currently experimental!

# The DCM_CI_KEY and DCM_EMAIL secrets are set in the admin settings page
# of the flutter/devtools repo. They can be found at: go/dash-devexp-dcm-keys
# These are associated with a trial license of DCM, and will need to be changed
# if we decide to purchase an actual license. The trial license will expire on
# April 11, 2024.

# If you want to install and run DCM locally, please refer to CONTRIBUTING.md
# for instructions.

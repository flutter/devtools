# Triage

## The Process

DevTools issues are triaged as time allows throughout the week, and during a dedicated triage meeting that occurs weekly.
During the triage meeting, new and existing issues are categorized, prioritized, and / or commented on to provide updates
or gather clarification.

The DevTools discord [channel](https://discord.com/channels/608014603317936148/958862085297672282) is also scrubbed for
any recent user questions / concerns that require a response.

For each issue, perform all of these tasks that apply:

### Label/project the issue:
* Add labels for its proper category or categories ( “Inspector page”, “debugger page”, “bug”, etc.)
* Add label “waiting for customer response” if you requested more details from reporter
* Add label “fix it friday” if the issue should be fixed and looks easy to fix
* Add label "good first issue" if the issue looks like an easy starter bug for a new contributor

### Prioritize the issue. 

Follow the prioritization rubric [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/contributing/issue_hygiene/README.md#priorities).

Tag the area owner in a comment if the issue requires specific expertise. Assign to an owner if the issue is a work in process or if the issue needs immediate / almost-immediate attention (P0, P1).

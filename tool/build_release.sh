# This avoids requiring an internet connection for CanvasKit at runtime.
# This URL should be updated to keep in sync with the version from the engine.
# See https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/lib/web_ui/lib/src/engine/canvaskit/initialization.dart#L50-L78,
# but compare with the code in master for getting the current version.
# A better solution would be to either upstream this functionality into the flutter_tools,
# (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74936), or to read this from a manifest 
# provided (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74934).

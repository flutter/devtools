## How to release the next version of DevTools

**Note:** If you need to publish a new version of devtools_server, you will need
to do that prior to performing these steps, and update the devtools pubspec.yaml
to reference the new published version of devtools_server. To publish devtools_server, run
`pub publish` from `packages/devtools_server`. Be sure to test the server locally
before publishing. For instructions on how to do that, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#devtools-server).

Create a branch for your release. Below we're creating release 0.0.15, with all the PRs.

## Update master branch and create a local release branch
```shell
cd ~/devtools-git/devtools

checkout master

git pull upstream master

git checkout -b release_0_0_15

```

## Update the release number by running files:

./tool/update_version.sh 0.0.15

Verify that this script updated the pubspecs under packages/
and updated all references to those packages. These packages always have their
version numbers updated in lock step so we don't have to worry about
versioning. Also make sure that the version constant in
**packages/devtools_app/lib/devtools.dart** was updated.

## Update the CHANGELOG.md
- **packages/devtools/CHANGELOG.md**

Add the release number and date followed by the features or changes e.g.,

```
## 0.0.15 - 2019-04-01
* Added a great feature ...
```

## Push the local branch

```shell

git commit -a -m “Prepare for v0.0.15 release.”

git push origin release_0_0_15
```

## Create the PR and Commit the above changes
From the git UI tool create the PR, squash and commit.

## Publishing DevTools
### Update your master branch from the remote repository
> Ensure that the tip of master is the above commit, just made with the exact set of PRs wanted.  Otherwise, checkout using the SHA1 of the above commit e.g.,
``` git checkout -b release_15 <SHA1>``` then proceed to the step 'Prep to publish'.

```shell
cd ~/devtools-git/devtools

git checkout master

git pull upstream master
```

### Prep to publish
```shell
./tool/publish.sh
``` 

### Publish
#### Verify the package works (DevTools)

- cd packages/devtools
- dart bin/devtools.dart
- open the page in a browser
- flutter run an application
- connect to the running app from devtools, and verify that the pages
  generally work, and there are no exceptions in the chrome devtools log

#### Publish the packages
Paste this multiline block into your console, and follow the confirmation prompts to upload the packages.

```shell
pushd packages/devtools_shared
pub publish
popd

pushd packages/devtools_server
pub publish
popd

pushd packages/devtools_testing
pub publish
popd

pushd packages/devtools_app
pub publish
popd

pushd packages/devtools
pub publish

```

#### Revert the change to .gitignore and pubspec files
```shell
git checkout .gitignore
git checkout packages/*/pubspec.yaml
```

#### Create the tag for this release and push to the remote repository.
This script will automatically determine the version from the `packages/devtools/pubspec.yaml` so there
is no need to manually enter the version.
```shell
tool/tag_version.sh
